# event-loop.crumb

`event-loop.crumb` is a [Crumb](https://github.com/liam-ilan/crumb) usable providing a basic event loop.

The event loop builds on Crumbs native `until` and `event` functions, providing the user with an abstracted way to interact with keypress and mouse events. Current implementation supports five events: **state**, **loop**, **keypress**, mouse **move** and mouse **click**.

## Usage

1. Download https://github.com/ronilan/event-loop.crumb/blob/main/event-loop.crumb
2. Place it in your Crumb project
3. Use it.

## Basics

The `event-loop` function expects two parameters `state` and `listeners`
- `state` is a data structure of the user choice that will persist between loops.
- `listeners`: `list` - a list of "entities" listening to events. Each "entity" is by itself a `list` containing exactly five event functions. Each of those functions will be called when each of the currently supported events happens. Listeners are proccessed in the order in which they are listed and the functions are called in the following order: 1 (loop), 2 (keypress), 3 (mouse move), 4 (mouse click) and finally 0 (state changed).

A minimal example that prints a never ending progress bar will look like this:
```
listeners = (list 
  (list void {(print "=")} void void void) // state loop keypress move click
)
state = void

// event loop
(use "./event-loop.crumb" {
  <- (start state listeners)
})
```

With Crumb's dynamic scoping, event functions are executed in `event-loop` scope. This allows event functions to "magically" access parameters defined within the event loop.

By virtue of being called from inside the `until` event loop, all event functions ahve access to:
`state`: `any` - the current state.
`loop-count`: `integer` - the number of loops since the event loop started.

The current implementation also exposes the following:
`keypress_name`: `string` - the name of the key pressed detected (e.g `a`, `A` `up`). Available to the keypress event function (third in list).
`mouse_xy`: `list` - the x (`number`) and y (`number`) coordinates  of the mouse with top left being `0 0`. Available to the mouse event functions (fourth and fifth in list).

Each event function, if defined, is expected to return a modified state.

A minimal reactive example that prints bars of increasing length whenever the state changes will look like this:

```
on_loop = { 
  <- (add state 1)
}

on_state = {
  (print (reduce (map (range state) {_ _ -> <- "="}) {accum item _ -> <- (join accum item)} "") "\n")
  <- state
}

listeners = (list 
  (list on_state on_loop void void void) // state loop keypress move click
)

state = 1

// event loop
(use "./event-loop.crumb" {
  <- (start state listeners)
})
```

## Running Examples

### With Docker:

Build: 
```
docker build -t event-loop.crumb git@github.com:ronilan/event-loop.crumb.git#main
```
Run: 
```
docker run --rm -it event-loop.crumb
```

Or "all in one": 
```
docker run --rm -it $(docker build -q git@github.com:ronilan/event-loop.crumb.git#main)
```

Then in the shell: 
```
./crumb examples/10-print.crumb
```

### Locally

Clone the repo: 
```
git clone git@github.com:ronilan/event-loop.crumb.git
```

CD into directory: 
```
cd event-loop.crumb
```

Build Crumb interpreter: 
```
chmod +x build-crumb.sh && ./build-crumb.sh
```

Run:
```
./crumb examples/10-print.crumb
```
