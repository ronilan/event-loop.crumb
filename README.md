# event-loop.crumb

`event-loop.crumb` is a [Crumb](https://github.com/liam-ilan/crumb) usable providing a basic event loop.

The event loop builds on Crumbs native `until` and `event` functions, providing the user with an abstracted way to interact with keypress and mouse events. Current implementation supports four events: loop, keypress, mouse move and mouse click.

## Usage

1. Download https://github.com/ronilan/event-loop.crumb/blob/main/event-loop.crumb
2. Place it in your Crumb project
3. Use it.

## Basics

The `event-loop` function expects two parameters `state` and `listeners`
- `state` is a data structure of the user choice that will persist between loops.
- `listeners`: `list` - "entities" listening to events. Each "entity" is by itself a `list` containing exactly four event functions. Each of those functions will be called when each of the currently supported events happens. The order of the functions is the order of the events: loop, keypress, mouse move and mouse click.

A minimal example that prints a never ending progress bar will look like this:
```
listeners = (list 
  (list {(print "=")} void void void)
)
state = void

// event loop
(use "./event-loop.crumb" {
  <- (start state listeners)
})
```

With Crumb's dynamic scoping, event functions are executed in `event-loop` scope. This allows event functions to "magically" access parameters defined within the event loop.

By virtue of being called from inside the `until` event loop all event functions ahve access to:
`state`: `any` - the current state.
`loop-count`: `integer` - the number of loops since the event loop started.

The current implementation also exposes the following:
`keypress_name`: `string` - the name of the key pressed detected (e.g `a`, `A` `up`). Available to the keypress event function (second in list).
`mouse_xy`: `list` - the x (`number`) and y (`number`) coordinates  of the mouse with top left being `0 0`. Available to the mouse event functions (third and fourth in list).

Each event function, if defined, is expected to return a modified state
A minimal example that prints bars of increasing length will look like this:

```
on_loop = { 
  (print (reduce (map (range state) {_ _ -> <- "="}) {accum item _ -> <- (join accum item)} "") "\n")
  <- (add state 1)
}

listeners = (list 
  (list on_loop void void void)
)
state = 1

// event loop
(use "./event-loop.crumb" {
  <- (start state listeners)
})
```

## Running Examples

### With Docker:

Build: 
```
docker build -t event-loop.crumb git@github.com:ronilan/event-loop.crumb.git#main
```
Run: 
```
docker run --rm -it event-loop.crumb
```

Or "all in one": 
```
docker run --rm -it $(docker build -q git@github.com:ronilan/event-loop.crumb.git#main)
```

Then in the shell: 
```
./crumb examples/10-print.crumb
```

### Locally

Clone the repo: 
```
git clone git@github.com:ronilan/event-loop.crumb.git
```

CD into directory: 
```
cd event-loop.crumb
```

Build Crumb interpreter: 
```
chmod +x build-crumb.sh && ./build-crumb.sh
```

Run:
```
./crumb examples/10-print.crumb
```
